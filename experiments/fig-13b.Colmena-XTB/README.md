To rerun the ColmenaXTB experiment and recreate the figure, go to
`https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7823513`, download the `colmena-exp.tar.gz` 
tarball to the local machine, untar the tarball, and follow the contained 
README.md. The tarball contains all software dependencies and workflow 
run scripts and molecular and machine learning datasets and should take around
35-40 GBs of local storage. Instructions the transaction logs used to generate 
the figures are also contained therein.
