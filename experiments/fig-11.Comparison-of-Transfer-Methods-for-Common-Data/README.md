To run these experiments 500 workers are needed. All three subplots in figure 11 are run on "fresh"
workers with empty caches. 

Each manager program corresponds to one of the subplots 11a, 11b, and 11c.

This experiment makes use of peer-to-peer transfers and therefore unimpeded 
communication between worker nodes is required. 

For each experiment, allocate 500 workers and launch one of the three manager programs. 

The transaction log will be located in the "runtime\_info" directory after program execution. Each 
run will store a new entry in the directory. The run may be plotted with the plotting tool.
